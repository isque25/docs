## Overview

The Agent Toolkit Playground lets you **interactively configure** and **execute** both the **Search** and **Extract** APIs, then instantly view:

- **Live JSON responses** with status codes and latency metrics
- **Auto-generated code snippets** in Python, JavaScript, and cURL, ready to copy



---

## Search API

Use the Search panel to explore web content. Adjust parameters such as `query`, `max_results`, `topic`, `language`, `country`, `summarize`, and `provider`.

The playground automatically generates matching code snippets and live responses side by side.

---

## Extract API

Switch to the Extract panel to test URL content extraction. Configure `url`, `include_images`, `include_links`, and `extract_depth`.

Results display as JSON, with code samples generated for easy copying.
